7-Segment Display Package

With this package you can create a variety of 7-segment displays, using the pre made prefabs or
creating custom displays. The display appearance can be chosen editing the "onColor" and "offColor" in the scripts.
Its possible to show numbers and text, in a 7-segment style. Open the "scene01" in test folder, to see some examples.

Clocks

This package include 2 digital clocks in Prefabs folder: Clock6Digits and Clock4Digits.
If you drag then directly in your project they will show the current system time. To show a custom time
remove the component "SetCurrentTimeXDigits". You can change the "text" string in "ClockXDigits" script to
show the desired time. The string must fill the whole display, considering the colon space. For example,
in the 4 digits clock valid strings are: "14:35" and "14 35";

Numeric Displays

You can create any lenght numeric displays combining some "Display7Seg" prefabs in a game object and adding the
script "ContainerDisplay7Seg" as component. You can use the prefabs "Display2Digits" and "Display4Digits" as
reference, or use them directly in your project. To change the text displayed you need set the string "text" in
the container script. Its recommended fill the whole display with characters. You can put dots in any place of the
string when desired, the script will correctly show them. For example, in "Display2Digits" prefab, valid strings can
be: "12", "1.2", "1.2.".
